  "description": "A minecraft complete overhaul mod that changes the game into a skill-based MMO sandbox inspired by the likes of Ultima Online, Shadowbane and Mortal Online. A full overhaul of all material tiers for crafting, a full replacement of all crafting bench types, crafting failure, usage-based skill gain and crafting/harvesting restricted by skill levels, as well as a fully fledged player-run economy supported by individual player skill caps so that crafting and pvp thrive based on an equal mix of supply and demand. Also implements a magic casting system, land and vendor/shop ownership with taxes, guild warfare and town building.",
